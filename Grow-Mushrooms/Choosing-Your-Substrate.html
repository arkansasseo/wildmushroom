		  <h1>Rye Berry Mushroom Substrate Grow Bag</h1>
<p>Cloning a mushroom basically means to cut a small piece from that mushroom and putting it into a substrate (like dirt to plant seeds) to grow out. Or they will put the small piece into an agar plate or liquid culture mixture. <img style="max-width: 50%; margin: 5px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516906561371-53f48df1254d?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MjAzfHxncm93aW5nLW11c2hyb29tc3xlbnwwfHx8\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="mushrooms+substrate" align="right" /> Most of the time people will use rye grain, popcorn grain or saw dust in a small bag and wait for that bag to completely fill with mushroom mycelium which is called mushroom spawn.</p>
<h2>Inoculate the Mushroom Substrate</h2>
<p>When your logs are properly &ldquo;cured,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s time to inoculate them with mushroom spawn. <img style="max-width: 50%; margin: 5px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518450757707-d21c8c53c8df?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MjEzfHxncm93aW5nLW11c2hyb29tc3xlbnwwfHx8\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="mushroom+substrate" align="left" /> Contrary to what some might think, you don&rsquo;t inject or dust logs with spores (which are the fungal equivalent of seeds). Rather, you use living mycelial&nbsp;(fungal) tissue on a nutritive substrate&hellip;a. K. A. &ldquo;spawn&rdquo; (like a cutting or tuber, if you&rsquo;re talking plants). Growing mushrooms from spores is an entirely different process, beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<p>Buy a mushroom cultivation kit: if you are a beginner, buying a kit really helps you get a feeling for how mushrooms grow. See our cultivation supplies links page for kits. Purchase spawn: from a local or online supplier and inoculate your own substrate, for example straw. This part is easy.</p>
<p>Pinning is one of the most exciting times in the growing cycle. Once your mycelium has fully colonised the substrate, it&rsquo;s time to expose it to different environmental conditions. This will trick it into thinking it has risen above ground and that it&rsquo;s time to fruit. A hygrometer is a key piece of equipment during this stage. These devices display readings for temperature and humidity. During pinning, mushrooms require high humidity, high co2, and light.</p>
<p>Mushroom spawn is some type of substrate that has been colonized by mushroom mycelium. Generally, shiitake mushroom spawn is purchased as either plug spawn or sawdust spawn. I&rsquo;d recommend starting with plug spawn. It&rsquo;s very easy to work use and requires few special tools. Plug spawn is small dowels that have been inoculated with shiitake mycelium. Sawdust spawn is generally cheaper, but it&rsquo;s a bit trickier to work with. A special inoculation tool is used to pack the sawdust into holes drilled in your mushroom logs.</p>
<p>You can purchase mushroom spawn in a variety of different forms and on a variety of different substrates. For log inoculation, your two options are &ldquo;sawdust spawn&rdquo; and&nbsp; &ldquo;plug spawn. &rdquo;the former requires a special tool to insert it properly into logs; the latter does not. As you might guess, sawdust spawn is much cheaper than plug spawn. Your choice will probably depend on how serious you are about growing mushrooms and how many logs you plan to inoculate.</p>
<p>If you're growing mushrooms indoors, there are a couple of options for materials you can use for planting. You can buy a mushroom grow kit already packed with a growing medium that's inoculated with mushroom spawn. Mushroom growing kits are a good place to start if you're new to the process because a kit will provide everything you need. If you start without a kit, the type of mushroom you choose to grow determines the substrate you grow the mushrooms on, so it's important to research each mushroom's needs. Button mushrooms are one of the easiest types to grow if you need a starting point!</p>
<h3>Why Hardwood in your mushroom substrate?</h3>
<p>Native to poplar wood, this is a delicious mushroom with a nutty bite. It&rsquo;s great for stir-fries and other cooking methods. Preferred fruiting substrates: hardwood sawdust is best. This one is great for jar cultivation. It also does well on logs and stumps. Climate: keep it cool &ndash;pioppinos like to stay around 13&ndash;18&deg;c (55&ndash;64&deg;f),and tend to fruit in the spring, after the colder months.</p>
<p>Again, if you are just getting started with growing mushrooms at home, oysters are the way to go. In the beginning, you will also need to decide whether you are going to use a substrate, or you are ready to inoculate hardwood logs. This depends on how much space you have available, just as much as it depends on the mushrooms you would like to eat, and how often you wish to eat them.</p>
<p>Each different type of mushroom has its own specific growing needs. Shiitakes can be grown on hardwood sawdust or wood. White button mushrooms and portobellos need to be grown on composted manure. Oyster mushrooms will grow on a variety of different substrates including straw and even cardboard or coffee grounds !</p>
<p>Lion&rsquo;s mane mushrooms (hericium erinaceus) are a somewhat common wood-decomposing mushroom that can be found throughout the northern hemisphere in hardwood forests. It is a choice edible mushroom hunted by many-a mushroom enthusiast and grown commercially worldwide. Our lion&rsquo;s mane mushroom growing kit is a colony of lion&rsquo;s mane mushroom mycelium (the white thread-like fungus) growing on sterilized alder sawdust. This mix, called substrate, serves as food for the fungus and provides the necessary nutrients to produce mushrooms, much like they would grow from a log in the forest.</p>
<p>Shiitake mushrooms have a full, smoky flavor and a dense texture that holds up well for cooking. They're easily found in stores, but you can likely grow them much more inexpensively at home. Growing shiitakes at home is rewarding. It might take a bit of time to get started, but once you&rsquo;re going they can produce sporadic flushes. Choosing your substrate is a very important part of growing shiitake mushrooms. If growing on hardwood logs, shiitakes can be produced for 3 to 5 years once the wood has been inoculated with mushroom spawn.</p>
<p>This is our favourite mushroom to grow in wood chip gardens. It&rsquo;s easy to grow and delicious to eat. Preferred fruiting substrates: hardwood wood chips are preferred, but,like oyster mushrooms, king stropharia will grow in straw and many other farm waste products. Climate: king stropharia grow in a very broad range of temperatures,from about 5&ndash;35&deg;c (41&ndash;95&deg;f), so they&rsquo;re great for both temperate and subtropical climates. They do need good moisture,.</p>
<h2>What is the mushroom yield per pound of substrate?</h2>
<p>This guide is based on robert &ldquo;psylocybe fanaticus&rdquo; mcpherson&rsquo;s eponymous pf tek&mdash;the method that revolutionized growing mushrooms indoors. Mcpherson&rsquo;s key innovation was to add vermiculite to a grain-based substrate (as opposed to using grain alone), giving the mycelium more space to grow and mimicking natural conditions. Although his method is a little more labor-intensive than others, often for a lower yield, its simplicity, low cost, and reliability make it ideally suited to beginners. It also makes use of readily available materials and ingredients, many of which you may already have.</p>
<p>Growing mushrooms on straw is a great step for many growers to grow on a higher-yielding, faster substrate that wants a little more preparation. This process of indoor mushroom growing becomes more economical to continuously producing mushrooms and produce a good yield. This is not the most effective method to commercially cultivate mushrooms but it can be a good starting point. This method is relatively straight forward.</p>
<p>A. Bisporus is a versatile mushroom that can be enjoyed three ways: harvest when white and immature for white button mushrooms, pick it when it is brown for crimini mushrooms, or wait until it reaches maturity and opens up its cap for portobello mushrooms. This kit will yield up to 4 pounds of mushrooms over a 4 to 6 week growing period and includes the growing box, the substrate colonized with mycelium, a casing layer, and detailed care instructions.</p>
<p>Although tried and tested by generations of mushroom growers, the brown rice flour and vermiculite substrate may not be the best choice for everyone. It depends on your priorities. Brown rice flour is good for growing in bulk, but coir may be cheaper and easier to use. Then there&rsquo;s whole brown rice (not flour), which supposedly yields more potent fruits.</p>
<p>With proper planning and distribution of costs, you can earn a profit margin of over 50% gross margin for a mushroom farm. This profit is before accounting for labor and overhead costs. However, this high margin requires cheap labor, minimal equipment, favorable weather, and low-cost operations. A small-scale operation only costs a couple hundred to set up, as it requires minimal equipment. As long as you have a dark room or a shady backyard, you can set up the spawn on a substrate to cultivate mushrooms. Once you are comfortable with the process, you can consider expanding to a more commercial management style, hiring employees to increase yields.</p>
<p>Mushrooms start out as spores and develop to full size in a matter of weeks. Mushroom farms can turn out five or more crops per column per year. Fifteen pounds per year per hundred square feet is not an unreasonable yield to expect, if temperature, humidity and growth media are properly managed and supplied.</p>
<h3>Substrate Preparation for White Button Mushrooms</h3>
<p>White button mushrooms are bar far the most popular variety for novice gardeners. Button mushroom goes with so many recipes, and growing them yourself is a rewarding and tasty experience. This variety also includes the portobello mushroom as well, and both grow in similar environments. Kits include trays and lids, along with the pre-spawned substrate, such as compost.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to order your spawned sawdust or mushroom plugs at least 4 weeks before you want to cultivate your logs. If you order sawdust, you may find heavily myceliated areas in the bag, where the sawdust is completely crusted in white or beige mycelium. There might even be buttons and mushrooms beginning to form. Just break these apart in the bag with the bag still sealed. The tool you use to push sawdust into the logs will help to break these apart, too. If you remove them from the bag, you&rsquo;ll find that you don&rsquo;t have much sawdust left to use. The mushrooms don&rsquo;t begin to fruit until they&rsquo;ve consumed their substrate, so by the time you see buttons forming a lot of the sawdust has been consumed by the fungi.</p>
<p>Other mushrooms can be grown in much the same way. The substrate, or growing medium, is different for some mushrooms but the process is virtually the same. Button mushrooms, the white globe-type mushrooms that most people are familiar with, are among the easiest to grow. They need a bed of composted manure. Oyster mushrooms grow best on straw while morel mushrooms grow best on apple wood.</p>
<p>Mix your substrate and pack it down firmly to allow the temperature to rise. Turn the substrate every few days to let it rot and create the nutrients necessary for the mushrooms to start the fruiting phase. White button mushroom growing kit you know you have good compost when it turns dark brown and smells sweet. Put enough of the substrate into the tray to meet a depth of 3-inches, and then spray the spore syringe over the substrate to inoculate it with the spores.</p>
