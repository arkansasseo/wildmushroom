<h1 id="1">Grow Mushrooms at Home</h1>
<p>We want to show you that if you make a monotub to grow fresh mushroomsat home you will boost your yield. Monotubs are easy to make and can yield huge flushes. This is the best way to grow dung loving mushrooms in the home or on a small scale. <img style="max-width: 30%; margin: 4px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/5SbY2Tk.jpg" alt="mushroom" width="228" height="156" align="right" /></p>
<p>Some mushrooms, such as the agaricus species commonly found in grocery stores require no light at all. However, those commonly grown by hobbyists, such as pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushrooms), lentinus enodes (shiitake), psilocybe cubensis, a hallucinogenic mushroom, and hericium erinaceus (lion's mane) all require light to produce abundant, normal sized fruits. Experience has taught us that the light best suited for primordia formation and the development of fruitbodies is bright light with a color temperature of 5,000 kelvin to 7,000 kelvin. Fortunately, this type of light is easily obtainable at your local home improvement center in the form of fluorescent fixtures. For a small terrarium as described in this chapter, a single cfl (compact fluorescent) that screws into a standard light bulb socket will work very well. These can often be found in grocery and drug stores in every neighborhood. 15 watt cfls will do the job well, but the package will probably have a large 60 stamped on it, indicating they produce light "equivalent" to a 60 watt incandescent light bulb. They're referring to lumens of output, not the frequency. Incandescent light bulbs are the worst possible choice for growing mushrooms, since they emit a 'red' light in the 3,000 kelvin color temperature range.</p>
<h2 id="2">How to Grow Mushrooms</h2>
<p>You now have a basic idea of how mushrooms grow and reproduce. Before we discuss cultivation methods, it&rsquo;s time to learn the basics of sterile technique. Mushrooms are up against a host of competitors in nature. They have to conquer all sorts of bacteria and fungi to secure a foothold. They sound tough, right? it&rsquo;s only in a domesticated environment that they reveal how sensitive they truly are. Even minor cases of contamination can bring an entire grow operation to its knees. It&rsquo;s for this reason that growers need to exercise extreme caution during every stage of the cultivation process.</p>
<p>Also known as pf tek this section of our page is presented in full to help you get started growing monotub method mushrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very happy with my first crop of pink oyster mushrooms! in the years since, i&rsquo;ve learnt so much about so many different things. These days, if someone asks me if they can make a living out of growing mushrooms i usually reply that: a) it&rsquo;s impossible for me to say as it depends on so many factors, and.</p>
<p>One of the most important mushroom growing supplies for growing high-quality, high-yielding mushrooms is spawn. Spawn should be sourced from a commercial operation and be contaminant free. If there are any forms of contamination in the spawn they will be expanded when a new substrate is inoculated. Even a small amount of contamination in the spawn source can result in all the inoculated bags becoming contaminated. There are commonly two different spawn types used: sawdust and grain. Grain has several benefits including its typically higher nutrient content than sawdust and lower generation. Sawdust has smaller inoculated points so it can be more evenly distributed in the inoculated medium. If inoculating more sawdust the mycelium is already creating the necessary enzymes to digest the sawdust which will lead to faster colonization.</p>

<h3 id="5">Tips for Beginner Mushroom Growers</h3>
<p>The exact origin of the golden teacher is unknown but it made it&rsquo;s appearance in the late 80&rsquo;s. It is a great mushroom strain for beginners while also being a favorite for advanced growers and has an average to high potency. It grows large mushrooms with wide golden caps caps and a thick stem and probably gets it&rsquo;s name from the color of it&rsquo;s caps. You can get several flushes (new growths) out of one batch and likes to grow in the following substrates.</p>
