		  <h1>Nutritional and medicinal value of mushrooms</h1>
<p>Besides their diverse and interesting culinary uses, mushrooms have nutritional and medicinal value. Some mushrooms contain cancer-fighting properties and some aid the body's immune system. Shiitake mushrooms and other fungi are good sources of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Shiitake contains proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates; vitamins a, b1, b2, c, d2; niacin, phosphorus, iron, calcium, and other minerals. According to dr. <img style="max-width: 60%; margin: 4px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501169823221-212bdeaf8556?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MjI1fHxncm93aW5nLW11c2hyb29tc3xlbnwwfHx8\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="mushrooms+medicinal" align="left" /> Kanichi mori, shiitake mushrooms lower serum cholesterol, have strong anti-tumor and anti-viral properties, very low fat, no starch, and more vitamin b12 than milk and fish. He considers shiitake nutritionally more valuable than the western staples corn, turnips, potatoes, tomatoes, and carrots. Although they have less protein than meat, the amount is comparable to peas and green beans.</p>
<h2>Medicinal Benefits of Edible Mushrooms</h2>

<p>There are so many different types of mushrooms , and plenty of different options when it comes to growing edible mushrooms for yourself. One of the huge benefits of growing your own mushrooms instead of harvesting them from the wild is that you can be certain you&rsquo;re not preparing a poisonous mushroom. As long as you get your spawn from trustworthy sources!</p>
<p>Like any medicine natural or otherwise, mushrooms can have a powerful effect and should be used with care. Mushrooms come in many shapes, sizes and varieties and it is vital to know what you are using especially when foraging for mushroom as some poisonous and even fatal varieties can be mistaken for edible types. Medicinal mushroom products can be bought online or from some health food shops. Take care to follow any instructions and watch for any reactions at first as adverse effects and allergies have been noted in some people. Dried and fresh mushrooms can also be bought from a range of places.</p>
<p>Mushrooms are known from ancient times for their medicinal properties and gastronomic properties. Therefore the consumption of edible wild-growing mushrooms has been very popular. The demand for the commercialization of edible wild mushrooms has proved to be a widely expanding business with increasing economic importance in many rural areas of some countries. In recent years, the consumption of edible.</p>
<p>If you are one of those who like to grow their own food at home, you should make an attempt to grow mushrooms indoors. Mushrooms are rich in nutrients, high in fiber, low in fat and calories with medicinal benefits. However, first of all, you need to decide which variety of mushrooms you would like to grow. Varieties like shitake, oyster and white buttons are easy to grow indoors but shitakes are highly prized and are most commonly grown.</p>
<h3>Medicinal/Gourmet Mushroom Liquid Culture Syringe</h3>
<p>When choosing your mushroom source you will have to decide between the following: spores with spores you will be dealing with a spore print or a spore syringe. Mycelium: with mycelium you will be dealing with agar plates, liquid cultures and grain spawn. I have written a separate article that goes into detail on the topic as well as how to use, source and prepare each method.</p>
<p>Liquid culture syringes contain mushroom mycelium suspended in a nutrient broth. After sterilizing the needle with a flame, transfer your culture through an injection port to sterilized nutrient broth, agar, grains, or bulk substrates. This technique empowers you to maintain relatively sterile technique without expensive lab equipment. Transfer with great success in the open air of your house, but for increased sterility, transfer within a glove box or in front of a flow hood.</p>
<p>The next phase was to buy liquid cultures of spores and create our own grow bags. Professionals have a lab and culture their own spores in agar while wearing cool lab coats. We aren&rsquo;t there yet. Instead i went online and found a few websites that sell liquid mushroom cultures in large syringes. Our teenage kids thought we were shooting up drugs or something (it does look a bit sketchy)! the best place to order liquid spores online was root mushroom farm. I took the&nbsp; syringes, inoculated them into quart jars of sterilized grain and set them to grow for two weeks. This is called &ldquo;colonizing your spawn&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You could make a liquid culture by mixing 1,500 ml of water, 1 tbsp raw honey and 1 tsp malt (then sterilize with a pressure cooker ). Then you can put spores or a small piece of mushroom into the liquid. Wait a couple weeks for myclium to grow inside the liquid, put into a syringe with needle and inject into your substrate (or you could just pour it in).</p>
<p>Try to find a local website (inside your country) which can provide a spore syringe or liquid culture. Reddit or ebay can also be a good source but make sure the seller has good reviews and you have exhausted other avenues first. Generally, you are more likely to find a liquid culture syringe if you are growing out gourmet mushrooms.</p>
<h2>Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms</h2>
<p>I used to hate fresh mushrooms until I tasted something better than the sour canned oyster mushrooms that line the shelves of grocery stores. I ate fresh shiitake gourmet mushrooms, the edible ones at a friend&rsquo;s and these was surprisingly fresh and delicious. My friend was growing gourmet mushrooms. The fancy gourmet ones you get in the high-end grocery stores. You know the oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, &amp; everything else in between. I decided to grow edible mushrooms too.</p>
<p>"Tried growing mushrooms before, and it didn't work" &ndash; if I had money for every time someone has said that to me i'd be a very rich manand probably no longer a mushroom farmer! mushrooms are notoriously unreliable to grow, partly due to the mass-produced low quality kits that people often try. Almost mystical organisms, they seem to pop up in the wild in an unpredictable way, often only appearing for just 5 or 6 days before vanishing back into the ground again, not to be seen in the same spot for another year or three. Yet, despite a poor reputation amongst home growers, by using a particularly simple technique and getting a bit of insight into how mushrooms grow, it is possible to successfully grow your own gourmet mushrooms at home. So how exactly are mushrooms cultivated? how can you have success at home? and more to that point - what's all this got to do with waste coffee grounds?</p>
<p>There are over 14,000 species of mushrooms known today and technically you could grow any of them at home. However, there are really only a handful of edible mushrooms that are worth growing if your purpose is to eat them for their taste or medicinal benefits. Another thing to consider is how you want to grow mushrooms at home and what your purpose for growing them is.</p>
<p>Back to the roots was started by two friends in college when they learned it was possible to grow mushrooms from plain old coffee grounds. Since then, they&rsquo;ve launched into the urban garden market with a number of great at-home products including this organic mushroom growing kit. In just ten days, you can grow delicious, gourmet oyster mushrooms right out of the box in just ten days.</p>
<p>Growing mushrooms can be a surprisingly tasty hobby or business. Not only are the fungi rather delicious, you can also benefit a lot from consuming them. Gourmet mushrooms are extremely rich in nutrients that help in promoting the good health of your body too. However, you might have to put some things in place before growing gourmet mushrooms at home to enjoy all these benefits without having to wait in long queues or hunt mushrooms in the wild.</p>
<h3>Reishi - the most commonly used medicinal mushroom</h3>
<p>Known for its medicinal properties related to immune health, this mushroom type has gained a lot of notoriety in recent years, and it is frequently consumed as a nutritional supplement. Gallboys reishi mushroom kit though we can&rsquo;t vouch for these claims (do your research!) this type has been used historically in japanese and chinese traditional medicine, and its popularity when consumed as a tea or powdered supplement continues to this day. The red and brown fungus has a strong, distinctive flavor.</p>
<p>What to look for when purchasing mushroom extracts medicinal mushrooms and their extracts are getting more popular every day. They support your immune system, neutralize the nasty side effects of medication and will also function as medication themselves. And all this without any side effects. Popular types are agaricus blazei (abm), reishi, chaga, cordyseps sinensis, shiitake, maitake and many, many more. Check the wikipedia article on medicinal mushrooms for an overview.</p>
<p>To answer a question with another question, i suggest you first ask yourself which mushrooms you&rsquo;d be interested in growing! as you may or may not already be aware species of cultivated mushrooms are lumped into one of two groups. On one hand we have our organic woodland cleanup crews consuming various woods &amp; wood wastes converting lignin into energy to proliferate &amp; ultimately (hopefully) produce mushrooms. These lignicolous fungi, we describe as lignophiles, otherwise known as wood loving mushrooms. On the other hand we have our dung loving coprophilic fungi aka coprophiles such as agaricus sp. , psilocybe sp. &amp; many others. Other areas of cultivation not directly related to gourmet mushrooms include medicinal use of parasitic fungi like cordyceps sp. &amp; fermented foods like red yeast rice or tempeh. As these are not the most commonly grown, the discussion will not focus on them, but these important fungi needed to be mentioned nonetheless! whichever mushroom interests you, continue reading to learn more about how to grow your own mushrooms!</p>
<p>This is a dedicated form of gardening that needs to be studied; i suggest you start with home-grown mushrooms from scratch: a practical guide to growing mushrooms outside and indoors , by magdalena and herbert wurth, a comprehensive guide to everything from oyster mushrooms to medicinal reishi. Growing from scratch, or more accurately spores, requires care, so start with a kit and go from there. I got a recycled plastic pot oyster mushroom kit for just under a tenner. It&rsquo;s perfect for the uninitiated, as oyster mushrooms grow in a wide range of conditions.</p>
<p>The mushrooms most commonly grown on logs [iii] include shitakes and the many different species of oysters (including some that are almost never available commercially). Reishis also grow on logs, not that they are edible, but they are a popular medicinal species. Other less well-known edible species happy to grow on logs include lion&rsquo;s mane, chicken-of-the-woods, maitake (also called hen-of-the-woods), nameko , and pioppini.</p>
<p>The wooden dowels contained in our gourmet mushroom plug bags are the mushroom spawn which will be used to inoculate logs. The dowels are fully colonized by the gourmet or medicinal mushroom species indicated on the label. Once the plugs have been inserted into a log they will get to work decomposing the wood of the log over a number of years. After 9-12 months of colonization, mushrooms will begin to appear and will produce seasonal crops until the log itself decomposes fully and falls apart (5-15 years depending on type of log used).</p>
<p>There are certain things you might need for your gourmet mushrooms to cultivate other than your fungi like lion&rsquo;s mane hericium or button mushrooms. Some of these things may include the following: a growing medium or substrate such as wood chips hardwood logs using them can also help you to understand all the necessary processes you may need to follow in order for your cultivation to be a stunning success at the end of the day.</p>
<p>In addition to how easy it is, growing mushrooms has many other benefits. You&rsquo;ll save money, have healthy ingredients for meals, and the number of gourmet dishes you can produce will increase. A recent article in the daily beast touted mushrooms as &ldquo;magic for women&rdquo; because they can help control blood sugar. Controlling blood sugar leads to weight stabilization, which is another major benefit of growing and consuming your own mushrooms.</p>
<p>As summer nights lengthen into autumn, the forests of the catskill mountains in upstate new york fill with magical, mystical, medicinal mushrooms. "toadstool" is a quaint name for the many mushrooms that spring forth between rains, while "fungi" is the more technical term. Fungi are plants, but plants without flowers or roots or chlorophyll (which makes plants green). Strange shapes (some quite sexually suggestive), the ability to grow (and glow) in the dark, and psychedelic colors make mushrooms an obvious addition to any witch&rsquo;s stew. But you will want some other reasons to make mushrooms a steady part of your diet. Is outwitting cancer a good enough reason?</p>
<p>When growing gourmet mushrooms in your house, you might have to carefully follow their normal life-cycle for them to fruit well for eventual harvest. If you don&rsquo;t do this, the growing mushrooms might not yield the expected result at the end of the day. Follow these steps to start small before growing a mushroom farm. So here are the steps many follow to grow mushrooms right the first time.</p>
