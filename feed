		  <h1>Rye Berry Mushroom Substrate Grow Bag</h1>
<p>Cloning a mushroom basically means to cut a small piece from that mushroom and putting it into a substrate (like dirt to plant seeds) to grow out. Or they will put the small piece into an agar plate or liquid culture mixture. <img style="max-width: 50%; margin: 5px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516906561371-53f48df1254d?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MjAzfHxncm93aW5nLW11c2hyb29tc3xlbnwwfHx8\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="mushrooms+substrate" align="right" /> Most of the time people will use rye grain, popcorn grain or saw dust in a small bag and wait for that bag to completely fill with mushroom mycelium which is called mushroom spawn.</p>
<h2>Inoculate the Mushroom Substrate</h2>
<p>When your logs are properly &amp;ldquo;cured,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s time to inoculate them with mushroom spawn. <img style="max-width: 50%; margin: 5px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518450757707-d21c8c53c8df?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MjEzfHxncm93aW5nLW11c2hyb29tc3xlbnwwfHx8\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="mushroom+substrate" align="left" /> Contrary to what some might think, you don&amp;rsquo;t inject or dust logs with spores (which are the fungal equivalent of seeds). Rather, you use living mycelial&amp;nbsp;(fungal) tissue on a nutritive substrate&amp;hellip;a. K. A. &amp;ldquo;spawn&amp;rdquo; (like a cutting or tuber, if you&amp;rsquo;re talking plants). Growing mushrooms from spores is an entirely different process, beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<p>Buy a mushroom cultivation kit: if you are a beginner, buying a kit really helps you get a feeling for how mushrooms grow. See our cultivation supplies links page for kits. Purchase spawn: from a local or online supplier and inoculate your own substrate, for example straw. This part is easy.</p>
<p>Pinning is one of the most exciting times in the growing cycle. Once your mycelium has fully colonised the substrate, it&amp;rsquo;s time to expose it to different environmental conditions. This will trick it into thinking it has risen above ground and that it&amp;rsquo;s time to fruit. A hygrometer is a key piece of equipment during this stage. These devices display readings for temperature and humidity. During pinning, mushrooms require high humidity, high co2, and light.</p>
<p>Mushroom spawn is some type of substrate that has been colonized by mushroom mycelium. Generally, shiitake mushroom spawn is purchased as either plug spawn or sawdust spawn. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend starting with plug spawn. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to work use and requires few special tools. Plug spawn is small dowels that have been inoculated with shiitake mycelium. Sawdust spawn is generally cheaper, but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit trickier to work with. A special inoculation tool is used to pack the sawdust into holes drilled in your mushroom logs.</p>
<p>You can purchase mushroom spawn in a variety of different forms and on a variety of different substrates. For log inoculation, your two options are &amp;ldquo;sawdust spawn&amp;rdquo; and&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;plug spawn. &amp;rdquo;the former requires a special tool to insert it properly into logs; the latter does not. As you might guess, sawdust spawn is much cheaper than plug spawn. Your choice will probably depend on how serious you are about growing mushrooms and how many logs you plan to inoculate.</p>
<p>If you're growing mushrooms indoors, there are a couple of options for materials you can use for planting. You can buy a mushroom grow kit already packed with a growing medium that's inoculated with mushroom spawn. Mushroom growing kits are a good place to start if you're new to the process because a kit will provide everything you need. If you start without a kit, the type of mushroom you choose to grow determines the substrate you grow the mushrooms on, so it's important to research each mushroom's needs. Button mushrooms are one of the easiest types to grow if you need a starting point!</p>
<h3>Why Hardwood in your mushroom substrate?</h3>
<p>Native to poplar wood, this is a delicious mushroom with a nutty bite. It&amp;rsquo;s great for stir-fries and other cooking methods. Preferred fruiting substrates: hardwood sawdust is best. This one is great for jar cultivation. It also does well on logs and stumps. Climate: keep it cool &amp;ndash;pioppinos like to stay around 13&amp;ndash;18&amp;deg;c (55&amp;ndash;64&amp;deg;f),and tend to fruit in the spring, after the colder months.</p>
<p>Again, if you are just getting started with growing mushrooms at home, oysters are the way to go. In the beginning, you will also need to decide whether you are going to use a substrate, or you are ready to inoculate hardwood logs. This depends on how much space you have available, just as much as it depends on the mushrooms you would like to eat, and how often you wish to eat them.</p>
<p>Each different type of mushroom has its own specific growing needs. Shiitakes can be grown on hardwood sawdust or wood. White button mushrooms and portobellos need to be grown on composted manure. Oyster mushrooms will grow on a variety of different substrates including straw and even cardboard or coffee grounds !</p>
<p>Lion&amp;rsquo;s mane mushrooms (hericium erinaceus) are a somewhat common wood-decomposing mushroom that can be found throughout the northern hemisphere in hardwood forests. It is a choice edible mushroom hunted by many-a mushroom enthusiast and grown commercially worldwide. Our lion&amp;rsquo;s mane mushroom growing kit is a colony of lion&amp;rsquo;s mane mushroom mycelium (the white thread-like fungus) growing on sterilized alder sawdust. This mix, called substrate, serves as food for the fungus and provides the necessary nutrients to produce mushrooms, much like they would grow from a log in the forest.</p>
<p>Shiitake mushrooms have a full, smoky flavor and a dense texture that holds up well for cooking. They're easily found in stores, but you can likely grow them much more inexpensively at home. Growing shiitakes at home is rewarding. It might take a bit of time to get started, but once you&amp;rsquo;re going they can produce sporadic flushes. Choosing your substrate is a very important part of growing shiitake mushrooms. If growing on hardwood logs, shiitakes can be produced for 3 to 5 years once the wood has been inoculated with mushroom spawn.</p>
<p>This is our favourite mushroom to grow in wood chip gardens. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to grow and delicious to eat. Preferred fruiting substrates: hardwood wood chips are preferred, but,like oyster mushrooms, king stropharia will grow in straw and many other farm waste products. Climate: king stropharia grow in a very broad range of temperatures,from about 5&amp;ndash;35&amp;deg;c (41&amp;ndash;95&amp;deg;f), so they&amp;rsquo;re great for both temperate and subtropical climates. They do need good moisture,.</p>
<h2>What is the mushroom yield per pound of substrate?</h2>
<p>This guide is based on robert &amp;ldquo;psylocybe fanaticus&amp;rdquo; mcpherson&amp;rsquo;s eponymous pf tek&amp;mdash;the method that revolutionized growing mushrooms indoors. Mcpherson&amp;rsquo;s key innovation was to add vermiculite to a grain-based substrate (as opposed to using grain alone), giving the mycelium more space to grow and mimicking natural conditions. Although his method is a little more labor-intensive than others, often for a lower yield, its simplicity, low cost, and reliability make it ideally suited to beginners. It also makes use of readily available materials and ingredients, many of which you may already have.</p>
<p>Growing mushrooms on straw is a great step for many growers to grow on a higher-yielding, faster substrate that wants a little more preparation. This process of indoor mushroom growing becomes more economical to continuously producing mushrooms and produce a good yield. This is not the most effective method to commercially cultivate mushrooms but it can be a good starting point. This method is relatively straight forward.</p>
<p>A. Bisporus is a versatile mushroom that can be enjoyed three ways: harvest when white and immature for white button mushrooms, pick it when it is brown for crimini mushrooms, or wait until it reaches maturity and opens up its cap for portobello mushrooms. This kit will yield up to 4 pounds of mushrooms over a 4 to 6 week growing period and includes the growing box, the substrate colonized with mycelium, a casing layer, and detailed care instructions.</p>
<p>Although tried and tested by generations of mushroom growers, the brown rice flour and vermiculite substrate may not be the best choice for everyone. It depends on your priorities. Brown rice flour is good for growing in bulk, but coir may be cheaper and easier to use. Then there&amp;rsquo;s whole brown rice (not flour), which supposedly yields more potent fruits.</p>
<p>With proper planning and distribution of costs, you can earn a profit margin of over 50% gross margin for a mushroom farm. This profit is before accounting for labor and overhead costs. However, this high margin requires cheap labor, minimal equipment, favorable weather, and low-cost operations. A small-scale operation only costs a couple hundred to set up, as it requires minimal equipment. As long as you have a dark room or a shady backyard, you can set up the spawn on a substrate to cultivate mushrooms. Once you are comfortable with the process, you can consider expanding to a more commercial management style, hiring employees to increase yields.</p>
<p>Mushrooms start out as spores and develop to full size in a matter of weeks. Mushroom farms can turn out five or more crops per column per year. Fifteen pounds per year per hundred square feet is not an unreasonable yield to expect, if temperature, humidity and growth media are properly managed and supplied.</p>
<h3>Substrate Preparation for White Button Mushrooms</h3>
<p>White button mushrooms are bar far the most popular variety for novice gardeners. Button mushroom goes with so many recipes, and growing them yourself is a rewarding and tasty experience. This variety also includes the portobello mushroom as well, and both grow in similar environments. Kits include trays and lids, along with the pre-spawned substrate, such as compost.</p>
<p>You&amp;rsquo;ll need to order your spawned sawdust or mushroom plugs at least 4 weeks before you want to cultivate your logs. If you order sawdust, you may find heavily myceliated areas in the bag, where the sawdust is completely crusted in white or beige mycelium. There might even be buttons and mushrooms beginning to form. Just break these apart in the bag with the bag still sealed. The tool you use to push sawdust into the logs will help to break these apart, too. If you remove them from the bag, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that you don&amp;rsquo;t have much sawdust left to use. The mushrooms don&amp;rsquo;t begin to fruit until they&amp;rsquo;ve consumed their substrate, so by the time you see buttons forming a lot of the sawdust has been consumed by the fungi.</p>
<p>Other mushrooms can be grown in much the same way. The substrate, or growing medium, is different for some mushrooms but the process is virtually the same. Button mushrooms, the white globe-type mushrooms that most people are familiar with, are among the easiest to grow. They need a bed of composted manure. Oyster mushrooms grow best on straw while morel mushrooms grow best on apple wood.</p>
<p>Mix your substrate and pack it down firmly to allow the temperature to rise. Turn the substrate every few days to let it rot and create the nutrients necessary for the mushrooms to start the fruiting phase. White button mushroom growing kit you know you have good compost when it turns dark brown and smells sweet. Put enough of the substrate into the tray to meet a depth of 3-inches, and then spray the spore syringe over the substrate to inoculate it with the spores.</p>

		  <h1>Harvest Mushrooms</h1>
<p><img style="max-width: 30%; margin: 6px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564320657752-82fc9160a939?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8Mjh8fGdyb3dpbmctbXVzaHJvb21zfGVufDB8fHw\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="mushrooms" align="left" /> The tell tale sign that your mushrooms are ready to harvest is that the head of each mushroom will now be fully separated from the stem and opened up completely.</p>
<p>Ready-to-go, living mycelium grow kits will be ready for harvest in as little as 2&amp;ndash;3 weeks. On the other hand, grow kits requiring inoculation and incubation can take as long as 5&amp;ndash;6 weeks until they&amp;rsquo;re ready for harvest. For cultivation from spores, the inoculation step takes the shortest amount of time (approximately a few hours). The next step, incubation, will take about 2&amp;ndash;4 weeks until the substrate is fully colonized, depending on the temperature (70&amp;ndash;80&amp;ordm;f is best). Once fruiting begins, it may take 7&amp;ndash;10 days to see the first tiny mushrooms, aka &amp;ldquo;pins. &amp;rdquo; however, some people have reported online that pinning can take as long as three weeks. Slower times generally result from colder temperatures and suboptimal humidity.</p>
<p>In the last 40 years, human understanding of fungi, and their role in farm and garden ecosystems, has grown dramatically. As a result, there is a wealth of new products on the market that help home gardeners and farmers alike in improving soil fertility while diversifying their harvest. I love mushrooms on my dinner plate , but even more so, i love what various fungi, both the edible and the nearly invisible, can do for small farms and homesteaders. The two major applications of fungi for the vegetable grower are called soil mycorrhizae [mahy-kuh&amp;ndash;rahy-zee], and myco-gardening. Soil mycorrhizae consist of vast networks of underground fungi that help our plants absorb diffuse nutrients while improving overall soil quality. Myco-gardening goes a step further, and utilizes edible and gourmet mushroom species as symbiotic, or companion plantings among various vegetable species.</p>
<p>When growing gourmet mushrooms in your house, you might have to carefully follow their normal life-cycle for them to fruit well for eventual harvest. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do this, the growing mushrooms might not yield the expected result at the end of the day. Follow these steps to start small before growing a mushroom farm. So here are the steps many follow to grow mushrooms right the first time.</p>
<p>Once the pins form, the mushrooms will roughly double size with each passing day. They will be ready to harvest when the veils open, or before the spores begin to fall from the gills. Multiple flushes (harvests) are possible after &amp;ldquo;cold shocking&amp;rdquo; the mycelium. For living mycelium grow kits, this may involve soaking the grow container in cold water for 12 hours, then re-following the instructions from step 1. Overall, up to 3&amp;ndash;4 flushes are possible, but the first flush is usually the largest.</p>
<h2>Why Risk It? Grow at Home Instead!</h2>
<p>With the abundance of information and materials available online, growing psilocybin mushrooms has never been more accessible and easy. Beyond being a fun project to undertake, indoor cultivation can generate impressive yields and bypass the inherent risks of gathering psilocybin mushrooms in the wild (e. <img style="max-width: 20%; margin: 5px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565057904502-928f4cef69f0?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8OHx8Z3Jvd2luZy1tdXNocm9vbXN8ZW58MHx8fA\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="mushroom" align="right" /> G. Mistaking them for poisonous varieties). This comprehensive guide, suitable for the beginner grower, will outline how to grow magic mushrooms at home.</p>
<p>This is one big mistake that many users make. Unless you choose the best-rated products in the segment, there is always the risk of contamination. You never know if there are spores of other mushrooms in the batch. Some of them might make you sick, and some might even be poisonous mushrooms. Therefore when you are growing vegetable plants of mushrooms at home, quality seeds and spores are critical.</p>
<p>Specialty mushrooms offer small-scale growers opportunities; however, there are risks. Do your homework before investing in land or production facilities. Read several books by different authors to get a balanced view of mushroom farming. Treat claims of quick and easy profits with great skepticism. Visit several mushroom growers outside your area to gain a grower&amp;rsquo;s eye view of what it is like to produce and market mushrooms. Join mushroom growers&amp;rsquo; organizations and attend conferences and workshops. Calculate your costs for starting and operating a mushroom farm, including labor costs. Determine break-even points and the time you will need to recapture your investment. Be conservative in estimating yields, sales, and profits. Plan on supporting your mushroom operation with savings or off-farm work until you pass the break-even point. In short, give yourself every chance for success.</p>
<h3>Mushroom Plugs and Wood: A Perfect Match</h3>
<p>Cultivating fungi at home is a fantastic way to see just how amazing nature is. With just a few tools, mushroom spawn plugs, and the proper growing medium, you will be on your way to witnessing something magical, right in your backyard. Maybe you love taking hikes and walks in the woods, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend your time searching and foraging for that perfect fungus to add to this evening&amp;rsquo;s dinner.</p>
<h2>Grow Mushrooms at Home</h2>
<p>When we finally bought our dream homestead, i considered trying to inoculate some hazelnut trees with truffle spawn. But, i discovered how expensive it was to get started and how long you had to wait for mushrooms and opted not to. Then, i thought about building a cellar and growing underground mushrooms&amp;hellip;.</p>
<p>First of all, mushroom growing kit helps you to grow around 500-800 grams of fresh mushrooms, right at your home. Within few weeks, you will see a flourishing mushroom growth in the comforts of your home. To grow mushrooms, you don&amp;rsquo;t need big space or some special equipments but all you need is patience.</p>
<p>Oyster mushrooms, with their overlapping layers of flesh, are sometimes hard to find in the grocery store, but they can be grown at home without too much trouble. These fungi have a meaty texture and mild flavor that is best used in cooked dishes, such as soups, saut&amp;eacute;s and casseroles. In fact, oyster mushrooms, like most mushrooms , contain small amounts of toxins that are destroyed in the cooking process, so cooking them is always a good idea. The antioxidants in mushrooms become more available to the body after mushrooms are cooked, as well, advises mushroom expert, paul stamets.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about growing mushrooms on the homestead and making a decent income? yes, your thoughts can turn into reality if you grow shiitake mushrooms on a log. Besides being tasty and packed with health benefits, growing mushrooms on substrates bring good business. What is shiitake mushroom? it is a japanese mushroom which means &amp;ldquo;mushroom of the oak&amp;rdquo; is cultivated widely in woods and looks like a flattened.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Mushroom Cultivation</h3>
<p>While an article such as this one cannot provide detailed instructions for mushroom cultivation, but can provide an overview so beginners can get a sense of what growing mushrooms on logs might involve.</p>
<p>When i tell people that i run an indoor mushroom farm, i find that a lot of people have never heard of such a concept, they don&amp;rsquo;t know specifics on how indoor cultivation works, or they ask if i am growing &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; mushrooms. So for my inaugural blog post i am going to cover the basics of mushrooms in general and an overview of indoor commercial cultivation.</p>
<p>Learning how to grow mushrooms is more straightforward than you might think. Much of the same information applies whether you want to grow a small amount of mushrooms at home as a hobby , or start growing mushrooms on a commercial scale as a business. Many of us grow up watching our parents in the garden picking tomatoes and carrots, but it&amp;rsquo;s still quite rare to see people growing their own mushrooms at home.</p>
<p>One of the most beneficial food products so far is the mushroom. It is a wonderful diet which can be easily grown at home in your kitchen garden. It is quite an easy process if the person is well acquainted with the art of growing mushrooms. This does not, however, mean that a novice cannot learn to grow mushrooms. One of the basics that a person intending to grow mushrooms must know is that it is very important to maintain a hygienic and disinfected environment.</p>
<p>A high-quality gourmet mushrooms grow kit can actually make growing a lot easier for you, especially if you are a beginner who&amp;rsquo;s yet to learn the basics of cultivating mushrooms indoors, or even outdoors for that matter. Growing without them first can be fun when you&amp;rsquo;re already an expert and not when you&amp;rsquo;re still a struggling mushroom tender.</p>
