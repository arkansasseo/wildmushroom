 Grow Mushrooms at Home 
 We want to show you that if you make a monotub to grow fresh mushroomsat home you will boost your yield. Monotubs are easy to make and can yield huge flushes. This is the best way to grow dung loving mushrooms in the home or on a small scale. 
 Some mushrooms, such as the agaricus species commonly found in grocery stores require no light at all. However, those commonly grown by hobbyists, such as pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushrooms), lentinus enodes (shiitake), psilocybe cubensis, a hallucinogenic mushroom, and hericium erinaceus (lion's mane) all require light to produce abundant, normal sized fruits. Experience has taught us that the light best suited for primordia formation and the development of fruitbodies is bright light with a color temperature of 5,000 kelvin to 7,000 kelvin. Fortunately, this type of light is easily obtainable at your local home improvement center in the form of fluorescent fixtures. For a small terrarium as described in this chapter, a single cfl</p>

 Discover the wonderful world of mushrooms via the following links what are mushrooms? wild and edible fungi &ndash; a global overview how do they grow ? how to do it at home (vertical veg) q&amp;a from mushroom canada. 
 Mushrooms are food that stays in the middle between healthy and dangerous. They are tasty all the time, but it is necessary to have some knowledge before eating them. Many of the eatable mushrooms have poisonous doubles and if you can&rsquo;t tell the difference you may be in trouble. Fortunately, the mushrooms sold in stores are grown in farms and therefore the danger of food poisoning is practically nonexisting. On the other hand, if you go on a hiking trip and intend to eat a&nbsp;wild mushroom, make sure that it is not poisonous. Bring with yourself a book about edible mushrooms, or a survival manual. Either way, it is best if you also travel with someone who has experience with wildlife and mushrooms. 
 Avocado: persin (which is found in every part of the avocado: fruit, bark, seed, leaves) is poisonous to dogs, but is especially dangerous in birds and rodents (thank you, pitaya!).</p>

              <p class="card-text">Nutritional and medicinal value of mushrooms 
 Besides their diverse and interesting culinary uses, mushrooms have nutritional and medicinal value. Some mushrooms contain cancer-fighting properties and some aid the body's immune system. Shiitake mushrooms and other fungi are good sources of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Shiitake contains proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates; vitamins a, b1, b2, c, d2; niacin, phosphorus, iron, calcium, and other minerals. According to dr. Kanichi mori, shiitake mushrooms lower serum cholesterol, have strong anti-tumor and anti-viral properties, very low fat, no starch, and more vitamin b12 than milk and fish. He considers shiitake nutritionally more valuable than the western staples corn, turnips, potatoes, tomatoes, and carrots. Although they have less protein than meat, the amount is comparable to peas and green beans.

              <p class="card-text">Rye Berry Mushroom Substrate Grow Bag 
 Cloning a mushroom basically means to cut a small piece from that mushroom and putting it into a substrate (like dirt to plant seeds) to grow out. Or they will put the small piece into an agar plate or liquid culture mixture. Most of the time people will use rye grain, popcorn grain or saw dust in a small bag and wait for that bag to completely fill with mushroom mycelium which is called mushroom spawn. 
 Inoculate the Mushroom Substrate 
 When your logs are properly &ldquo;cured,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s time to inoculate them with mushroom spawn. Contrary to what some might think, you don&rsquo;t inject or dust logs with spores (which are the fungal equivalent of seeds). Rather, you use living mycelial&nbsp;(fungal) tissue on a nutritive substrate&hellip;a. K. A. &ldquo;spawn&rdquo; (like a cutting or tuber, if you&rsquo;re talking plants). Growing mushrooms from spores is an entirely different process, beyond the scope of this post. 
 Buy a mushroom cultivation kit: if you are a beginner, buying a kit really helps you get a feeling for how mushrooms grow. See our cultivation supplies links page for kits. Purchase spawn: from a local or online</p>

              <p class="card-text">Harvest Mushrooms 
 The tell tale sign that your mushrooms are ready to harvest is that the head of each mushroom will now be fully separated from the stem and opened up completely. 
 Ready-to-go, living mycelium grow kits will be ready for harvest in as little as 2&ndash;3 weeks. On the other hand, grow kits requiring inoculation and incubation can take as long as 5&ndash;6 weeks until they&rsquo;re ready for harvest. For cultivation from spores, the inoculation step takes the shortest amount of time (approximately a few hours). The next step, incubation, will take about 2&ndash;4 weeks until the substrate is fully colonized, depending on the temperature (70&ndash;80&ordm;f is best). Once fruiting begins, it may take 7&ndash;10 days to see the first tiny mushrooms, aka &ldquo;pins. &rdquo; however, some people have reported online that pinning can take as long as three weeks. Slower times generally result from colder temperatures and suboptimal humidity. 
 In the last 40 years, human understanding of fungi, and their role in farm and garden ecosystems, has grown dramatically. As a result, there is a wealth of new products on the market that help home gardeners and farmers alike in improving soil fertility while diversifying</p>
